            <h3>Discriptions:</h3>
            <p>The open-world map is the largest and most diverse in the series to date, featuring not only the neon-soaked streets of Vice City but also the surrounding areas like the Leonida Keys (based on the Florida Keys), the swampy Grassrivers (based on the Everglades), Port Gellhorn, Ambrosia, and Mount Kalaga National Park. The game world satirizes contemporary American culture, including social media trends and internet memes.</p>

                <li><strong>JASON DUVAL:</strong> Jason grew up around grifters and crooks. After a stint in the Army trying to shake off his troubled teens, he found himself in the Keys doing what he knows best, working for local drug runners. It might be time to try something new.</li>

        <h2>Forza Horizon Cars designs inspairation by PlayStation 5 and Xbox</h2>

        <section>
            <h3>Descriptions:</h3>
            <p>In honor of the well-liked racing simulation being available on both Xbox and PlayStation 5, Forza Horizon 5 has a new livery for one of its fastest cars.  Xbox and Lamborghini have shown a unique design for the 2024 Lamborghini Revuelto that incorporates both the green hue of the Xbox and the blue color of the PlayStation in Forza Horizon 5.</p>
           <p>Given that the Forza franchise has been confined to Xbox since its launch just over 20 years ago, gamers worldwide were mainly taken aback when it was revealed that Forza Horizon 5 would be available on the PlayStation 5.  Since its April 29 release, Forza Horizon 5 has gained a lot of popularity on the PS5, with an estimated 700,000 new players joining the game.</p>
           <p>As part of the extensive Horizon Realms update for Forza Horizon 5, which also includes new prize vehicles, returning Evolving World destinations, modes, honors, and more, the Lamborghini Revuelto was added not long ago.  First, players need to finish the Horizon Stadium Circuit in order to unlock the Revuelto.  The collaboration livery can then be unlocked using the code 687 884 132 in the player's garage.  From front to back, the elegant design seamlessly transitions from Xbox green to PlayStation blue, with hexagonal accents around the edges for further visual flair.  The collaboration also produced a unique, real-life model of the vehicle (via IGN).</p>
